# CryptoClustering

This is my submission for Unsupervised Machine Learning Module.

In the repository you will find a folder with the Source file crypto_market_data.

In the main folder you will find jupyter notebook with my solution to the challenge.
Please note that I was not able to verify if hover cols work on scatter plots, as this funcions doesn't work on my PC.

Thanks,

Katharina
